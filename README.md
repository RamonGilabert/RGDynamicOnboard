# Still working on it...

## RGDynamicOnboard

A nicely dynamic slideshow to present whatever you want, just add an image, some text and choose one of the animations, RGDynamicOnboard will take care of the rest.

## Featuring

- As easy as entering a string and choosing some animations.
- For all devices, calculated sizes dinamically.

## Upcoming features

- TextField support, you're going to be able to listen to some methods once you are typing.
- Adding custom fonts into the alert view.
- More customization (ideas?).
